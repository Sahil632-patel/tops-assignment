                                                                       CSS ASSIANMENT 

Q-1: What is a CSS selector? Provide examples of element, class, and ID selectors.

ANS: A CSS selector is a pattern used to select and style HTML elements. It defines which elements the styles should apply to.

Ex:of CSS Selectors:
                 1]  Element Selector
                    Targets all instances of a specific HTML tag.
p {
  color: blue;
}

                 2] Class Selector
                    Targets elements with a specific class attribute.
.highlight {
  background-color: yellow;
}

                 3] ID Selector
                    Targets an element with a specific ID attribute (unique per page).
#header {
  font-size: 24px;
}


Q-2: Explain the concept of CSS specificity. How do conflicts between multiple stylesget
resolved?

ANS:  CSS Specificity Calculation
Each selector has a specificity value based on the following components:

Inline Styles (e.g., style="color: red;") → Highest specificity (1,0,0,0).
IDs (#id) → High specificity (0,1,0,0).
Classes, Attributes, and Pseudo-classes (.class, [attr], :hover) → Medium specificity (0,0,1,0).
Elements and Pseudo-elements (div, h1, ::before) → Low specificity (0,0,0,1).

EX: 

/* Specificity: (0,0,1,1) */
p.class { color: blue; }

/* Specificity: (0,1,0,0) */
#id { color: red; }

      How Conflicts Are Resolved
Higher Specificity Wins → The rule with the highest specificity is applied.
Equal Specificity → Last Rule Wins → If two rules have the same specificity, the one appearing later in the CSS file is applied.
!important Overrides → If a rule has !important, it takes priority regardless of specificity (except for inline styles with !important).

EX:

p { color: green; }            /* (0,0,0,1) */
p.special { color: blue; }     /* (0,0,1,1) */
#unique { color: red; }        /* (0,1,0,0) */

 
Q-3: : What is the difference between internal, external, and inline CSS? Discuss the
advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

ANS: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style HTML documents. There are three main ways to apply CSS to a webpage: Internal CSS, External CSS, and Inline CSS. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages.

      1. Inline CSS
         Definition:
                    Inline CSS is applied directly within an HTML element using the style attribute.
Ex:
<p style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">This is a paragraph.</p>

Advantages:

✅ Quick and easy for small changes
✅ No need for an external file
✅ Useful for testing or overriding styles dynamically

Disadvantages:

❌ Hard to maintain for large projects
❌ Reduces code readability
❌ Increases file size and load time (due to repeated styles)
❌ Does not support reusability

       2. Internal CSS
          Definition:
          Internal CSS is written within the <style> tag inside the <head> section of an HTML document.
EX:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <style>
        p {
            color: blue;
            font-size: 18px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>

Advantages:

✅ Keeps styles in one place within the HTML document
✅ Easier to maintain than inline CSS
✅ Reduces HTTP requests (compared to external CSS)

Disadvantages:

❌ Not reusable across multiple pages
❌ Can make the HTML file bulky if there are too many styles
❌ Affects website performance if styles are large

       3. External CSS
          Definition:
          External CSS is written in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML file using the <link> tag.

EX:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>

CSS (styles.css):

EX:

p {
    color: green;
    font-size: 22px;
}


Advantages:

✅ Best for large projects (keeps code organized)
✅ Reusable across multiple HTML files
✅ Improves website performance (cached CSS files load faster)
✅ Enhances maintainability and readability

Disadvantages:

❌ Requires an extra HTTP request (unless cached)
❌ No immediate effect on a single HTML file (requires linking)
❌ Won’t work if the external file fails to load

Which Approach is Best?

Feature	Inline CSS	Internal CSS	External CSS

Best for	Quick fixes, single elements	Small projects, single-page styling	Large projects, multiple pages
Reusability	❌ No	❌ Limited	✅ Yes
Performance	❌ Poor (repeated styles)	⚠️ Medium	✅ Best (cached styles)
Maintenance	❌ Hard	⚠️ Moderate	✅ Easy
Readability	❌ Poor	⚠️ Moderate	✅ Best

                                                                 CSS BOXMODEL  


Q-1: Explain the CSS box model and its components (content, padding, border,
margin). How does each affect the size of an element.

ANS: The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept in web development that defines how elements are displayed and how their dimensions are calculated. Every HTML element is considered as a rectangular box, consisting of the following components:

     1. Components of the Box Model:

        Content – The actual content inside the element, such as text or images. The size of this area is controlled by properties like width and height.
        Padding – The space between the content and the border. It increases the total size of the element while keeping the content intact.
        Border – The edge surrounding the padding and content. The thickness and style of the border are controlled by properties like border-width, border-style, and border-color.
        Margin – The outermost space around the element, creating distance between elements. It does not affect the element’s size but affects spacing between elements.

     2. How Each Component Affects Element Size:

        By default, the total size of an element is calculated as:

        Total Width
        =
        Content Width
        +
        Padding (left + right)
        +
        Border (left + right)
        +
        Margin (left + right)
        Total Width=Content Width+Padding (left + right)+Border (left + right)+Margin (left + right)
        Total Height
        =
        Content Height
        +
        Padding (top + bottom)
        +
        Border (top + bottom)
        +
        Margin (top + bottom)
        Total Height=Content Height+Padding (top + bottom)+Border (top + bottom)+Margin (top + bottom)

    3.  Box-Sizing Property:
          By default, browsers use the content-box model where width and height apply only to the content, and padding/border increase the total size.

        box-sizing: border-box;

Q-2: What is the difference between border-box and content-box box-sizing inCSS? Which is the default?

ANS: In CSS, the box-sizing property determines how the total width and height of an element are calculated. The two main values for box-sizing are:

content-box (Default)

This is the default value in CSS.
The width and height properties only include the content area, excluding padding and border.
The total size of the element is calculated as:
Total Width
=
content width
+
padding
+
border
Total Width=content width+padding+border
Total Height
=
content height
+
padding
+
border
Total Height=content height+padding+border

EX: div {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 5px solid black;
  box-sizing: content-box; /* Default */
}


2. border-box

The width and height properties include the content, padding, and border.
The total size remains the same as defined in width and height, making it easier to manage layout.
The content area is automatically adjusted to fit inside the specified width and height.
Formula:
Content Width
=
width
−
(
padding
+
border
)
Content Width=width−(padding+border)
Content Height
=
height
−
(
padding
+
border
)
Content Height=height−(padding+border)

EX: div {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 5px solid black;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

Key Differences:

Property	content-box (Default)	border-box
Includes padding & border in width/height?	❌ No	✅ Yes
Easier for layout consistency?	❌ No	✅ Yes
Default behavior in CSS?	✅ Yes	❌ No
Most modern layouts use border-box because it makes sizing more predictable, especially with padding and borders. You can apply it globally using: 

* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

                                                                   CSS FLEXBOX

Q-1:: What is CSS Flexbox, and how is it useful for layout design? Explain the terms
flex-container and flex-item.

ANS:  CSS Flexbox (Flexible Box)
      CSS Flexbox is a layout model designed to arrange elements efficiently within a container, even if their sizes are unknown or dynamic. It is particularly useful for designing responsive layouts by distributing space dynamically among elements.

Flexbox simplifies complex layouts by providing:

Alignment (horizontal & vertical)
Space distribution (even spacing, centering, etc.)
Responsive design support

Key Concepts:

    1. Flex Container
       A flex container is the parent element that holds flex items. It is created by applying display: flex; or display: inline-flex; to an element.

Ex:
CSS.
 .container {
   display: flex;
   justify-content: center;  /* Centers items horizontally */
   align-items: center;  /* Centers items vertically */
 }

   2. Flex Items
      Flex items are the child elements inside a flex container. These items can be adjusted using properties like flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis.

EX:
 .item {
   flex-grow: 1; /* Items will expand equally */
   flex-basis: 100px; /* Minimum size before growing */
 }

Q-2: : Describe the properties justify-content, align-items, and flexdirection used in Flexbox.

ANS: In CSS Flexbox, the properties justify-content, align-items, and flex-direction control the layout and alignment of flex items inside a flex container.

1] justify-content:

 Defines how flex items are aligned along the main axis (horizontal by default).
 Common values:
 flex-start (default) – Items align at the start of the flex container.
 flex-end – Items align at the end.
 center – Items align in the center.
 space-between – Items are spaced evenly, with no space at the edges.
 space-around – Items have equal space around them.
 space-evenly – Items have equal space between and around them.

2] align-items

 Defines how flex items are aligned along the cross axis (vertical by default).
 Common values:
 flex-start – Items align at the start of the cross axis.
 flex-end – Items align at the end.
 center – Items align in the center.
 stretch (default) – Items stretch to fill the container.
 baseline – Items align based on their text baseline. 

3] flex-direction

 Defines the main axis direction of the flex container.
 Common values:
 row (default) – Items are placed in a horizontal row, left to right.
 row-reverse – Items are placed in a horizontal row, right to left.
 column – Items are placed in a vertical column, top to bottom.
 column-reverse – Items are placed in a vertical column, bottom to top.

                                                                     CSS GRID

Q-1: : Explain CSS Grid and how it differs from Flexbox. When would you use Grid over
Flexbox?

ANS:  CSS Grid
  CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that allows developers to design web layouts using rows and columns. It provides precise control over placement and alignment of elements in both horizontal and vertical directions.

 Key Features of CSS Grid:

1]: Two-Dimensional Layout – Works with both rows and columns simultaneously.
2]: Grid Container & Grid Items – Elements inside a display: grid; container behave according to defined rows and columns.
3]: Explicit & Implicit Grids – You can define a grid structure explicitly (grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns) or let CSS create implicit rows/columns as needed.
4]: Flexible Sizing – Use fr units, percentages, minmax(), or auto to define cell sizes.
5]: Grid Lines & Areas – Use grid-row-start, grid-column-start, grid-template-areas for precise placement.
6]: Alignment & Spacing – Control alignment with justify-items, align-items, place-items, and gap.

   Flexbox:
   Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system designed for arranging elements in either a row or a column.

  Key Features of Flexbox:

1]: One-Dimensional Layout – Works in a single direction (either row or column).
2]: Flex Container & Flex Items – display: flex; makes the child elements flex dynamically.
3]: Main & Cross Axes – Uses flex-direction to define the main axis (row or column).
4]: Flexible Sizing & Distribution – flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis determine how space is allocated.
5]: Alignment & Justification – Use justify-content, align-items, align-self for alignment.
6]: Automatic Wrapping – flex-wrap: wrap; allows elements to move to the next row or column when space is insufficient.

When to Use Grid vs. Flexbox?

Use Case	           CSS Grid	                        Flexbox

Complex layouts 	Best for overall page layout	Not ideal for whole-page structures

Row & column control	Ideal (2D control)	       Limited to one dimension (1D)

Component alignment	Limited flexibility	       Great for aligning UI components

Dynamic content 	Works well with templates	Best for items with unknown width/height

Spacing & gaps	      gap for rows & columns	        gap works only in flex containers

Responsiveness	   Can be combined with media queries	Flexible for dynamic resizing

Q-2: : Describe the grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows, and grid-gap
properties. Provide examples of how to use them.
 
ANS:  CSS Grid Properties:
       grid-template-columns: Defines the number and size of columns in a grid.
       grid-template-rows: Defines the number and size of rows in a grid.
       grid-gap (deprecated) / gap: Defines the spacing between rows and columns.

  1]. grid-template-columns Example:
    This property specifies the number of columns and their widths.

.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 100px 200px auto;
}

  2]. grid-template-rows Example
         Defines row heights.

.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: 50px 100px auto;
}

  3].gap (Previously grid-gap) Example
     Defines spacing between grid items.

.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 100px 100px;
  gap: 10px; /* Both row and column gaps */
}

Combined Example:

.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 150px);
  gap: 20px;
}

                                                   Responsive Web Design with Media Queries



Q-2: : What are media queries in CSS, and why are they important for responsive
design?

ANS: Media queries in CSS are a feature that allows you to apply styles based on the characteristics of a user's device, such as screen width, height, resolution, and orientation. They are crucial for responsive design, ensuring that web pages adapt and look good on different screen sizes and devices.

 Why Media Queries are Important for Responsive Design:

  1]. Device Adaptability – Helps web pages adjust their layout and styling based on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
  2]. Improved User Experience – Ensures readability, usability, and aesthetics remain optimal across all devices.
  3]. Performance Optimization – Loads only the necessary styles, improving site speed and efficiency.
  4]. Future-Proofing – Adapts to new devices with varying screen dimensions without major redesigns. 

EX:

/* Default styles for all devices */

/* Styles for tablets (width up to 768px) */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightgray;
  }
}

/* Styles for mobile devices (width up to 480px) */
@media (max-width: 480px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}

Q-2: : Write a basic media query that adjusts the font size of a webpage for screens
smaller than 600px.

ANS: You can use the following basic CSS media query to adjust the font size for screens smaller than 600px:

EX:

@media (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    font-size: 14px;
  }
}
 

                                                            Typography and Web Fonts

Q-1: : Explain the difference between web-safe fonts and custom web fonts. Whymight
you use a web-safe font over a custom font?

ANS: Difference Between Web-Safe Fonts and Custom Web Fonts:

  1]. Web-Safe Fonts

      These are fonts that are pre-installed on most operating systems and devices (e.g., Arial, Times New Roman, Verdana, Georgia).
      They ensure consistency across different platforms because users already have them installed.
      They don’t require additional downloads, making web pages load faster. 

  2]. Custom Web Fonts

      These are fonts that are not necessarily installed on a user’s device and must be loaded from an external source (e.g., Google Fonts, Adobe Fonts, self-hosted fonts).
      They allow for greater design flexibility and branding opportunities.
      They may slightly impact page load speed since they need to be fetched from a server. 

Why Use a Web-Safe Font Over a Custom Font?

 Performance – Web-safe fonts load instantly since they don’t require additional HTTP requests.
 Compatibility – They work reliably across all devices and browsers without fallback issues.
 Accessibility – Some older browsers or restricted environments may block custom font downloads.
 SEO & UX – Faster load times contribute to better user experience and potentially improved SEO rankings.   

Q-2: What is the font-family property in CSS? How do you apply a custom GoogleFont
to a webpage?

ANS: What is the font-family Property in CSS?
The font-family property in CSS is used to specify the font of text on a webpage. It allows you to set a primary font and fallback fonts in case the primary font is not available.

Syantax:

selector {
  font-family: "Primary Font", "Fallback Font", generic-family;
}

 The first font is the preferred one.
 If it's not available, the browser tries the next one.
 Generic families (serif, sans-serif, monospace, etc.) act as a final fallback.

Ex:

p {
  font-family: "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif;
}

How to Apply a Custom Google Font to a Webpage?
Google Fonts provides free web fonts that can be easily added to a webpage.

Steps to Use a Google Font:

   1. Import the Font from Google Fonts 
     There are two ways to include Google Fonts:

  Method 1: Using a <link> tag in HTML
    Add the following <link> tag inside the <head> section of your HTML file:

<head>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
</head>

  Method 2: Using @import in CSS
 Add this to the top of your CSS file:
Ex: 
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap');

 2. Apply the Font in CSS
   After importing, use font-family to apply it:

body {
  font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
}
