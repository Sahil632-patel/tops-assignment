      <h2>Left Column</h2>
      <p>There is no place like home! A house might be a shelter but is way different than a home. A home is a place to feel safe, loved, cozy, and so much more! No one could change my mind about what a home is, because a home is where you learn from your mistakes, be yourself, and feel like you belong.</p>

    <div class="column right">
      <h2>Right Column</h2>
      <p>I personally think that everyone deserves a home, it doesn’t matter what the person’s past was like. We all deserve a home. No matter how big or small the home is, it is what is on the inside. You don’t have to impress anyone with your home. What matters is if you think it is a home.
